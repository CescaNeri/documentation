Story #1a As a customer, I want to open the mobile application and search for free scooters in my area. Story #1b As a customer, I want to be able to select a scooter near myself and make it ring in order to find it if it's hidden. Story #1c As a customer, I want to confirm on my phone and start riding. When I'm done, I want to leave the scooter where I can and confirm the end of the trip on the app. Story #2 As a customer, when I'm searching a scooter, I want to know its battery level in advance. Story #3a When a scooter is taken out of the area of service borders, it locks. Story #3b As a customer, when I'm approaching the area of service border, I want to be warned about the possibility that my scooter gets locked. How do you want to get warned? I'd like the scooter to play a specific sound, while I get a notification on my phone. Story #4 As a customer, I want to be warned when the battery is running low. I want to be warned with a ringtone. Story #5 When the battery goes below a threshold, the scooter enters a power save mode, during which it runs slower than normal. Story #6 When the battery is running low, the scooter warns the customer, if present, that the run must end and enters a standby mode during which it's disabled. Story #7 As the business manager, I want to be able to see the position and the battery level of every scooter in a map. Story #8 As the business manager, I want to get suggestions about strategic places for the drop points of the next day. Story #9 As a business employee I want to be able to unlock freely the scooters in order to move them. Story #10 The scooter should discourage theft and vandalism by playing a message when moved while locked or disabled. Story #11 As the business manager, I want the customers to pay for rides through the existing system. Does the legacy system keep track of all users data? If I remember correctly, yes. From the legacy system documentation: The legacy payment system needs access to trip data and to customers rent/unlock requests.","title":"Use Cases"},{"location":"Use%20Cases.html#use-cases","text":"","title":"Use Cases"},{"location":"Use%20Cases.html#user-stories","text":"Some user stories are taken from end users and some other are taken from the business representative, business employees.","title":"User stories"},{"location":"Use%20Cases.html#story-1a","text":"As a customer, I want to open the mobile application and search for free scooters in my area.","title":"Story #1a"},{"location":"Use%20Cases.html#story-1b","text":"As a customer, I want to be able to select a scooter near myself and make it ring in order to find it if it's hidden.","title":"Story #1b"},{"location":"Use%20Cases.html#story-1c","text":"As a customer, I want to confirm on my phone and start riding.
