This layer can also define high level processes or constraints that are encapsulated inside Domain Services . Entities and domain services can notify the occurrence of any relevant state change using Domain Events . Contracts Layer Defines a set of External Events that are used by other microservices to react to state changes outside of their bounded context. These events are typically emitted by the Application Layer in response to internal domain events and expose a subset of the properties of the domain event itself. Application Layer Defines a collection of Handlers that encapsulate the use cases exposed by the service and acts as an entry point to the domain layer. This layer is also responsible of managing Authorization , data access, consistency and external communication by delegating to the Infrastructure Layer . To keep application logic as clean as possible, this communication uses Infrastructure Interfaces declared by the application layer itself, but implemented in Infrastructure . Infrastructure Layer This layer holds the concrete implementation of the technology-agnostic interfaces declared by the Application Layer or by the Domain Layer . These interfaces typically model behavior related to Persistence , External Communication and other Utility Services required by other layers. API Layer Represents the entry point that clients of the service use to make requests. Clients can make requests using the REST API exposed by each microservice, therefore this layer defines a set of Controllers that declare which endpoints are supported. In addition, this is where each service defines its DTOs (Data Transfer Objects, i.e. the objects modeling the format of communication with clients).

When I'm done, I want to leave the scooter where I can and confirm the end of the trip on the app. 2 - Battery level As a customer, when I'm searching a scooter, I want to know its battery level in advance. 3a - Area of service policy When a scooter is taken out of the area of service borders, it locks. 3b - Customer notification of the area border As a customer, when I'm approaching the area of service border, I want to be warned about the possibility that my scooter gets locked. How do you want to get warned? I'd like the scooter to play a specific sound, while I get a notification on my phone. 4 - Power save policy When the battery goes below a threshold, the scooter enters a power save mode, during which it runs slower than normal. 5 - Customer notification of battery usage As a customer, I want to be warned when the battery is running low. I want to be warned with a ringtone. 6 - Battery exhausted policy When the battery is running low, the scooter warns the customer, if present, that the run must end and enters a standby mode during which it's disabled. 7 - Monitoring of scooters As the business manager, I want to be able to see the position and the battery level of every scooter in a map. 8 - Insights from the system As the business manager, I want to get suggestions about strategic places for the drop points of the next day. 9 - Unlock policy for employees. As a business employee I want to be able to unlock freely the scooters in order to move them. 10 - Vandalism prevention The scooter should discourage theft and vandalism by playing a message when moved while locked or disabled. 11 - Integration with legacy payment system As the business manager, I want the customers to pay for rides through the existing system. Does the legacy system keep track of all customers data? If I remember correctly, yes. From the legacy system documentation: The legacy payment system needs access to trip data and to customers rent/unlock requests.
